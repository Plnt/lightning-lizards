<p>Want to be a speaker? Great! The range of <a href="#topics">topics</a> is pretty broad and a <a href="#format">five
minute time box</a> makes this a good opportunity to participate even for newcomers
- so don't hesitate to submit a proposal. Here are the steps to sign up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/bkutil/lightning-lizards">lightning lizards repository</a></li>
<li>Edit the <a href="https://github.com/bkutil/lightning-lizards/blob/gh-pages/README.md">README.md</a> -
 add your name and topic to the list. Where you put yourself into the list is imporant,
 it will be the order of speakers.</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> to update the online page.</li>
<li>Commit the changes and open a pull request against the gh-pages branch.</li>
<li>Take a look at <a href="#talk">talk</a> and the <a href="#stage">stage</a>
 sections. Making yourself familiar with the environment and the setup in advance
 might make your talk a bit less stressful for you.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use the same channel if you have feedback, liked a particular topic, or
want us to improve something - feel free to create a GitHub issue or a pull
