<h2><a name="contributing">Contributing</a></h2>

Want to be a speaker? Great! The range of [topics](#topics) is pretty broad and a [five
minute time box](#format) makes this a good opportunity to participate even for newcomers
- so don't hesitate to submit a proposal. Here are the steps to sign up:

  1. Fork the [lightning lizards repository](https://github.com/bkutil/lightning-lizards)
  1. Edit the [README.md](https://github.com/bkutil/lightning-lizards/blob/gh-pages/README.md) -
     add your name and topic to the list. Where you put yourself into the list is imporant,
     it will be the order of speakers.
  1. Run `make` to update the online page.
  1. Commit the changes and open a pull request against the gh-pages branch.
  1. Take a look at [talk](#talk) and the [stage](#stage)
     sections. Making yourself familiar with the environment and the setup in advance
     might make your talk a bit less stressful for you.

You can use the same channel if you have feedback, liked a particular topic, or
want us to improve something - feel free to create a GitHub issue or a pull
request.

We accept external speakers as well, so if you don't work for SUSE, but would
still like to speak, or if you want to invite someone, feel free to do that!

<h2><a name="talk">Talk</a></h2>

  - English preferred, but Czech is cool too, if you're not comfortable w/ your English.
  - Please send in the slides at least 4 hours in advance, so we can download
    them before the talks start and check they display OK (hint: more contrast is
    better).
  - 1 minute for preparation, 4 minutes talk. This is optimal, but not a hard limit, though.
  - After the presentation, please publish your slides and send us a link, or send a pull request.
  - Talks will be recorded. If you don't want the recording of your talk to be
    published, please let us know.

### Equipment

  - Hand held wireless microphone.

    The laptop is connected to a video mixer, so it is not (yet) possible
